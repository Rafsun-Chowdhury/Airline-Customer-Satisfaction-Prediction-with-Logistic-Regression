# ✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction – Logistic Regression Analysis

This project explores whether in-flight entertainment affects customer satisfaction using logistic regression. It demonstrates how a single service-related feature can effectively predict satisfaction based on historical airline customer feedback.
