# ✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction – Logistic Regression Analysis

This project explores how in-flight entertainment influences customer satisfaction using logistic regression. The goal is to help airlines understand whether improving entertainment services can predict and potentially increase customer satisfaction. The analysis uses cleaned passenger feedback data and builds a binary classification model using a single predictor.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world airline passenger feedback data  
- Use one-hot encoding to prepare the target variable (`satisfaction`)  
- Train a logistic regression model to predict satisfaction based on the quality of in-flight entertainment  
- Visualize the logistic regression curve  
- Evaluate the model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- A **positive correlation** exists between in-flight entertainment ratings and overall satisfaction.  
- The logistic regression model achieved solid accuracy and precision using a **single feature**.  
- Results suggest that in-flight entertainment is a strong standalone predictor of customer satisfaction.
